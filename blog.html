      <h1 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 26px;">Discuss the scope of <span>var</span>, <span>let</span>, and
        <span>const</span>
      </h1>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">var Scope:</span> <br>
        In JavaScript, the var keyword is function-scoped. This means that a variable declared using var is visible
        throughout the entire function in which it is declared, regardless of block structures. Additionally, if a
        variable is declared using var outside any function, it becomes a global variable and is accessible throughout
        the entire program. One notable characteristic is that var declarations are hoisted to the top of their
        containing function or global scope, which means they are moved to the top during the compilation phase.
        <br>
        <br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> let and const Scope:</span><br>
        In contrast to var, both let and const have block-level scope. This means that they are confined to the block in
        which they are declared, whether that be an if statement, loop, or any other block structure. Variables declared
        using let or const are not hoisted to the top of their scope in the same way var is. Instead, they are hoisted,
        but not initialized until the line of code is executed. This behavior can help avoid certain issues related to
        hoisting.
        <br>
        <br>


        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> Reassignment and Immutability:</span>

        Another key distinction lies in reassignment and immutability. Variables declared with var can be reassigned and
        updated freely. On the other hand, variables declared with let can be reassigned, but they cannot be re-declared
        in the same scope. Variables declared with const are constants and cannot be reassigned. They must be assigned a
        value at the time of declaration, and once assigned, their value cannot be changed.

        <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> Hoisting:</span>

        Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their
        containing scope during the compilation phase. Both var and function declarations are hoisted, but there are
        differences. var declarations are hoisted and initialized with undefined, while let and const declarations are
        hoisted but remain uninitialized until the actual line of code where they are declared.
        <br>
        <br>

        In conclusion, while var has function-level scope and some hoisting peculiarities, let and const provide
        block-level scoping and are generally preferred for their more predictable behavior and support for creating
        constants.

    <div style="margin-top: 50px;">
      <h1 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 26px;">Tell us the use cases of <span>null</span> and
        <span>undefined</span>
      </h1>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">null:</span> <br>
        It is explicitly assigned by developers to variables, indicating the intentional absence of any object value.
        Commonly used when a variable is expected to hold an object later but starts without one. For example,
        initializing a variable:
        <br>

      <p>let myVariable = null;
      </p>

      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> undefined:</span><br>
      This value is often the default state when a variable is declared but not explicitly assigned a value. It can also
      result from accessing properties that do not exist in objects or when a function is called with fewer arguments
      than its declared parameters.
      <br>
      <p>let someVariable;
        <br>
        console.log(someVariable); // Outputs: undefined
      </p>



      Understanding these distinctions allows developers to use null when they want to indicate a deliberate absence of
      an object and recognize undefined as a default state or a result of specific language behaviors. Both play
      essential roles in writing clear, intentional, and error-resistant code.</p>

      <h1 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 26px;">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
      <p> 
        <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;"> REST API:</span> short for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a widely adopted
        architectural style for designing networked applications. It provides a set of conventions and rules that
        facilitate the building and interaction of web services, aligning with the principles of REST. The fundamental
        idea behind REST API is to establish a standardized approach for communication over the Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol (HTTP).
        <br>
        <br>
        REST follows several key principles to ensure simplicity, scalability, and uniformity in the design of APIs. It
        emphasizes stateless communication, meaning that each client request to the server must contain all the
        necessary information for the server to comprehend and fulfill the request. The API maintains a uniform
        interface, utilizing resource-based URLs, standard HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE), and
        commonly employing representations like JSON or XML for data exchange.
        <br>
        <br>
        A core concept of REST is the identification and manipulation of resources. Resources, which can be data objects
        or services, are uniquely identified by URLs and can be interacted with using standard HTTP methods. The
        client-server architecture, where the client handles the user interface and the server manages requests and
        resources, is a fundamental aspect of REST. Additionally, REST emphasizes a stateless server, meaning that the
        server doesn't store client state between requests.
        <br>
        <br>
        Due to its simplicity, scalability, and widespread support, REST APIs have become a standard choice for enabling
        communication between different systems and services on the web. JSON, providing a lightweight and
        human-readable data format, is commonly used with REST for data interchange, contributing to the widespread
        adoption of this architectural style in modern web development.
